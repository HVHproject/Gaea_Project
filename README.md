# Gaea_Project
An app for discovering the world around you. This is a capstone Joseph and Aleksander are working on for the Spring 2022 semester.
We went into this with 0 knowledge on app development and javascript.

## How do I run this app?
####Step 1: Install Expo on your computer and Expo/Expo Go on your device
Computer installation : https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/
Android installation  : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent
Apple installation    : https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779

####Step 2: Download this project and save it in a folder.

####Step 3: In that folder, run npm install.
This should download everything you need to run the project. If errors occur, you may need to install missing packages.
As time passes, packages can update or the language can update and something else can break.
Below are the packages we use.
npm i react-google-autocomplete

####Step 4: Get the needed API keys.
